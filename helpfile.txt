NAME:
	CBIG_preproc_fMRI_preprocess.csh

DESCRIPTION:
	The pipeline processes fMRI data and projects the data to 
	(1) FreeSurfer fsaverage5, fsaverage6 space
	(2) FreeSurfer nonlinear volumetric space
	(3) FSL MNI152 1mm, MNI152 2mm space.
        
	The pipeline proceeds sequentially as follows (default order), you can change the order and parameters 
	by changing the config file:
	(1) [CBIG_preproc_skip -skip 4] 
	    skips first 4 frames of resting data. 
	(2) [CBIG_preproc_fslslicetimer -slice_timing <st_file>] or [CBIG_preproc_fslslicetimer -slice_order <so_file>]
	    does slice time correction using FSL slicetimer. If the user does not pass in the slice acquisition direction 
	    -direction <direction>, this step will use "Siemens" acquisition direction Superior-Inferior as default. 
	    If the direction is Right-Left, <direction> should be 1 representing x axis.
	    If the direction is Anterior-Posterior, <direction> should be 2 representing y axis.
	    If the direction is Superior-Inferior, <direction> should be 3 representing z axis.
	    We recommend the users to pass in the slice timing information <st_file> instead of slice order <so_file>
	    (especially for multi-band data). The slice timing file can contain multiple columns (separated by a space) 
	    if the slice timing is different for different runs (checkout this example: example_slice_timing.txt).
	    If the user does not pass in both the slice timing file <st_file> and the slice order file <so_file>, 
	    this step will use "Siemens" ordering as default:
	    if the number of slices is odd, the ordering is 1, 3, 5, ..., 2, 4, 6, ...; 
	    if the number of slices is even, the ordering is 2, 4, 6, ..., 1, 3, 5, ....
	(3) [CBIG_preproc_fslmcflirt_outliers -FD_th 0.2 -DV_th 50 -discard-run 50 -rm-seg 5 -spline_final] 
	    does motion correction with spline interpolation and calculates Framewise Displacement and DVARS, 
	    then generates a vector indicating censored frames (1:keep 0:censored). This step throws away the
	    runs where the number of outliers are more than the threshold set by -discard-run option.
	(4) [CBIG_spatial_distortion_correction -fpm "oppo_PED" -j_minus <j_minus_image> -j_plus <j_plus_image>\
		-j_minus_trt <j_minus_total_readout_time> -j_plus_trt <j_plus_total_readoutime>\
	    -ees <effective_echo_spacing> -te <TE>]
		or
		[CBIG_preproc_spatial_distortion_correction -fpm "mag+phasediff"\ 
	    -m <magnitude_image> -p <phase_difference_image> -delta <phase_image_TE_difference> -ees <effective_echo_spacing>\
	    -te <TE>]
	    corrects for spatial distortion caused by susceptibilty-induced off-resonance field. This step requires fieldmap
	    images (either in magnitude and phase differnce form or opposite phase encoding directions form) and assumes that 
	    the functional image has gone through motion correction. Note that in the case of opposite phase ecnoding 
	    direction, please ensures that FSL version is 5.0.10, the outputs may otherwise be erroneous; also, this script 
	    currently only supports phase encoding directions along AP (j-) and PA (j) directions. For more details, please 
		refer to our spatial distortion correction READEME here: $CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/ 
		CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/spatial_distortion_correction_readme.md
	(5) [CBIG_preproc_multiecho_denoise -echo_time 12,30.11,48.22]
	    Apply optimal combination of different echos and denoising by ME-ICA method using TEDANA. This step needs 
		echo times for each echo in order. For more details, please refer to our readme for multi-echo preprcessing: 
		$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/multi_echo_tedana_readme.md
	(6) [CBIG_preproc_bbregister] 
	    a) Do bbregister with fsl initialization for each run. 
	    b) Choose the best run with lowest bbr cost. Apply the registration matrix of the best run to 
	    other runs and recompute the bbr cost. If the cost computed using best run registration is 
	    lower than the cost computed using the original registration generated in step a), use the best 
	    run registration as the final registration of this run. Otherwise, use the original registration.
	    c) To save disk space, it also generates a loose whole brain mask and applies it to input fMRI 
	    volumes. If you follow the default config file, then the input fMRI volumes are motion corrected volumes.
	(7) [CBIG_preproc_regress -whole_brain -wm -csf -motion12_itamar -detrend_method detrend -per_run -censor \
	     -polynomial_fit 1] 
	    regresses out motion, whole brain, white matter, ventricle, linear regressors for each run seperately. 
	    If the data have censored frames, this function will first estimate the beta coefficients ignoring the 
	    censored frames and then apply the beta coefficients to all frames to regress out those regressors.  
	(8) [CBIG_preproc_censor -nocleanup -max_mem NONE] 
	    removes (ax+b) trend of censored frames, then does censoring with interpolation. For interpolation method, 
	    please refer to (Power et al. 2014). In our example_config.txt, "-max_mem NONE" means the maximal memory usage 
	    is not specified, the actual memory usage will vary according to the size of input fMRI file (linearly 
	    proportional). If you want to ensure the memory usage does not exceed 10G, for example, you can pass in 
	    "-max_mem 9".
	(9) [CBIG_preproc_despiking]
	    uses AFNI 3dDespike to conduct despiking. This function can be used to replace censoring interpolation step (6),  
	    depending on the requirement of users.
	(10) [CBIG_preproc_bandpass -low_f 0.009 -high_f 0.08 -detrend] 
	    does bandpass filtering with passband = [0.009, 0.08] (boundaries are included). This step applies FFT 
	    on timeseries and cuts off the frequencies in stopbands (rectanguluar filter), then performs inverse FFT 
	    to get the result.
	(11) [CBIG_preproc_QC_greyplot -FD_th 0.2 -DV_th 50]
	    creates greyplots for quality control purpose. Greyplots contain 4 subplots: framewise displacement trace (with 
	    censoring threshold), DVARS trace (with censoring threshold), global signal, and grey matter timeseries.
	    In our default config file, we only create the grey plots just before projecting the data to surface/volumetric 
	    spaces because our aim is to see how much artifacts are there after all data cleaning steps. If the users want 
	    to compare the greyplots after different steps, they can insert this step multiple times in the config file 
	    (but must be after CBIG_preproc_bbregister step because it needs intra-subject registration information to 
	    create masks).
	(12) [CBIG_preproc_native2fsaverage -proj fsaverage6 -down fsaverage5 -sm 6] 
	    projects fMRI to fsaverage6, smooths it with fwhm = 6mm and downsamples it to fsaverage5.
	(13) [CBIG_preproc_FC_metrics -Pearson_r -censor -lh_cortical_ROIs_file <lh_cortical_ROIs_file> \
	      -rh_cortical_ROIS_file <rh_cortical_ROIs_file>]
	    computes FC (functional connectivity) metrics based on both cortical and subcortical ROIs. The cortical ROIs 
	    can be passed in by -lh_cortical_ROIs and -rh_cortical_ROIs. The subcortical ROIs are 19 labels extracted 
	    from aseg in subject-specific functional space. This function will support for multiple types of FC metrics
	    in the future, but currently we only support static Pearson's correlation by using "-Pearson_r" flag. 
	    If "-censor" flag is used, the censored frames are ignored when computing FC metrics.
	(14) [CBIG_preproc_native2mni_ants -sm_mask \
	      ${CBIG_CODE_DIR}/data/templates/volume/FSL_MNI152_masks/SubcorticalLooseMask_MNI1mm_sm6_MNI2mm_bin0.2.nii.gz \
	      -final_mask ${FSL_DIR}/data/standard/MNI152_T1_2mm_brain_mask_dil.nii.gz]
	    first, projects fMRI to FSL MNI 2mm space using ANTs registration; second, smooth it by fwhm = 6mm within 
	    <sm_mask>; and last, masks the result by <final_mask> to save disk space.
	    Caution: if you want to use this step, please check your ANTs software version. There is a bug in early builds 
	    of ANTs (before Aug 2014) that causes resampling for timeseries to be wrong. We have tested that our codes 
	    would work on ANTs version 2.2.0. 
	(15) [CBIG_preproc_native2mni -down FSL_MNI_2mm -sm 6 -sm_mask <sm_mask> -final_mask <final_mask>] 
	    it has the similar functionality as (13) but using FreeSurfer with talairach.m3z, not ANTs. We suggest the 
	    users use (13) instead of (14).
	    First, this step projects fMRI to FreeSurfer nonlinear space; second, projects the image from FreeSurfer 
	    nonlinear space to FSL MNI 1mm space; third, downsamples the image from FSL MNI 1mm space to FSL MNI 2mm space; 
	    fourth, smooths it by fwhm = 6mm within <sm_mask>; and last, masks the result by <final_mask> to save disk 
	    space.
	

	Note: this pipeline assumes the user has finished FreeSurfer recon-all T1 preprocessing.
	
	This pipeline also assumes that no reorientation is needed. To decide whether reorientation is required, 
	load volumes on freeview. If the following statements are true, you do not need to reorient your data:
	- Scroll down coronal, 2nd voxel coordinate decreases
	- Scroll down sagittal, 1st voxel coordinate increases
	- Scroll down axial, 3rd voxel coordinate decreases
	If reorientation is needed, please refer to fslreorient2std command.
	 
	Please be aware that T1-T2* registration step must be done before CBIG_preproc_regress and CBIG_preproc_censor. 
	The latter two steps need registration information to create masks.
	
	To know how to do QC checks, please refer to README.md in the same folder as this script.

	                            The symbol # in the config file also means comment, you can write anything you want if 
	                            you begin a line with #. Each line of the config file representing a function or step 
	                            of our preprocessing pipeline, the order of the step representing our preprocessing 
	                            order, so it is easy to change the order of your preprocessing according to changing 
	                            the config file. In this config file, you can also specify the option of each function. 
	                            For example, if you want to skip first 4 frames of the fMRI data, you can add the 
	                            option (-skip 4) behind the CBIG_preproc_skip. For further details about these options, 
	                            you can use option (-help) for each function, such as (CBIG_preproc_skip -help).

OUTPUTS: 
	CBIG_fMRI_preprocess.csh will create the directory <output_dir>/<subject> as specified in the options. Within the 
	<output_dir>/<subject> folder, there are multiple folders:

	1. surf folder contains the intermediate and final preprocessed fMRI data on the surface. 
		For example, 
		surf/lh.Sub0033_Ses1_bld002_rest_skip4_stc_mc_resid_interp_FDRMS0.2_DVARS50_bp_0.009_0.08_fs6_sm6_fs5.nii.gz 
		is bold data from run 002 ("bld002") of subject "Sub0033_Ses1" that has been projected to the left hemisphere 
		("lh"). The remaining descriptors in the filename describe the order of the processing steps. In particular,
		"rest" = resting state fmri
		"skip" = first four frames have been removed for T1 equilibrium
		"stc" = slice time correction
		"mc" = motion correction
		"resid" = regression of motion, whole brain, ventricular, white matter signals (standard fcMRI preprocessing)
		"interp_FDRMS0.2_DVARS50" = do interpolation for the censored frames defined by Framewise Displacement > 0.2,
		                            DVARS > 50, 
		"bp_0.009_0.08" = bandpass filtering with passband = [0.009, 0.08] (boundary inclusive).
		"fsaverage6" = data projected to fsaverage6 surface
		"sm6" = data smoothed with a FWHM = 6mm kernel on the surface
		"fsaverage5" = data downsampled to fsaverage5 surface

	2. vol folder contains the intermediate and final preprocessed fMRI data in the MNI152 and freesurfer nonlinear 
	   volumetric spaces.
		For example, 
		a.

		"mc" = motion correction
		"resid" = regression of motion, whole brain, ventricular, white matter signals (standard fcMRI preprocessing)
		"interp_FDRMS0.2_DVARS50" = do interpolation for the censored frames defined by Framewise Displacement > 0.2, 
		                            DVARS > 50, 
		"bp_0.009_0.08" = bandpass filtering with passband = [0.009, 0.08] (boundary inclusive).
		"MNI2mm" = projecting the data to MNI152 nonlinear 2mm volumetric space by ANTs
		"sm6" = data smoothed with a FWHM = 6mm kernel
		"finalmask" = masking the final image to save space.
		b. 
		vol/Sub0033_Ses1_bld002_rest_skip4_stc_mc_resid_interp_FDRMS0.2_DVARS50_bp_0.009_0.08_FS1mm_MNI1mm_MNI2mm_\
		sm6_finalmask.nii.gz 
		is the BOLD data of run 002 ("bld002") in subject "Sub0033_Ses1", generated after CBIG_preproc_native2mni step. 
		The remaining descriptors in the filename describe the order of the processing steps. In particular,

		"MNI1mm" = projection of data to MNI152 nonlinear 1mm volumetric space
		"MNI2mm" = downsampling of data to MNI152 nonlinear 2mm volumetric space
		Other stems are same as in subsection a.
		
	3. logs folder contains all log files for our preprocessing.
		CBIG_fMRI_preprocess.log contains the log info of CBIG_fMRI_preprocess.csh function, which is a wrapper script.
		Similarly, the name of the log file indicates the function, for example, CBIG_preproc_regress.log corresponds 
		to the function CBIG_preproc_regression.csh. Other log files: env.log includes all environment variables; 
		git.log includes the last git commit info; Sub0033_Ses1.bold contains the run numbers of this subject after 
		censoring; cleanup.txt includes all intermediate files that have been deleted, the user can use -nocleanup 
		option to keep these volumes.
	   
	4. bold folder contains the intermediate files for each step.
		bold/002 folder contains all intermediate bold volumes of run 002.
		For example, Sub0033_Ses1_bld002_rest_skip4_stc_mc.nii.gz is the volume after skip -> slice-timing correction 
		-> motion correction

		bold/mask folder contains all the fMRI masks.
		For example, Sub0033_Ses1.func.ventricles.nii.gz means that it's a functional ventricle mask for the subject 
		Sub0033_Ses1; Sub0033_Ses1.brainmask.bin.nii.gz means that it's a binarized brainmask for subject Sub0033_Ses1.

		bold/regression folder contains all regressors and lists for the glm regression.
		For example, Sub0033_Ses1_bld002_all_regressors.txt means all regressors of subject Sub0033_Ses1, run 002.

		bold/mc folder contains the output files of fsl_motion_outliers, and some intermediate files when detecting 
		high-motion outliers. For example, Sub0033_Ses1_bld002_rest_skip4_stc_motion_outliers_DVARS is the text file of 
		DVARS value of each frame of Sub0033_Ses1, run 002;	Sub0033_Ses1_bld002_rest_skip4_stc_motion_outliers_FDRMS is 
		the text file of FDRMS value of each frame of Sub0033_Ses1, run 002;

	5. qc folder contains all the files that are useful for quality control.
		For example:
		CBIG_preproc_bbregister_intra_sub_reg.cost contains the number of bbregister cost in T1-T2* registration.
		Sub0033_Ses1_bld002_mc_abs.rms, Sub0033_Ses1_bld002_mc_abs_mean.rms, Sub0033_Ses1_bld002_mc_rel.rms, and 
		Sub0033_Ses1_bld002_mc_rel_mean.rms are motion parameters.
		Sub0033_Ses1_bld002_FDRMS0.2_DVARS50_motion_outliers.txt contains the outlier labels of frames (1-keep, 
		0-censored). For introduction of more qc files, please refer to quality_control_readme.md in the same folder of 
		this script.
		
	6. FC_metrics folder contains all files related to this subject's FC (functional connectivity) metrics.
	   It contains three subfolders currently"
	   FC_metrics/ROIs contains the 19 subcortical ROIs file;
	   FC_metrics/lists contains the input lists for corresponding matlab function;
	   FC_metrics/Pearson_r contains the static Pearson's correlation of this subject.
